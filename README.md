# Finality Loader

[简体中文](README_CHS.md) || [繁体中文](README_CHT.md)

Finality Loader is used to load and modify code within the game, while also providing extensive functionality for plugins.

## Installation
1. Download the latest version of Finality Loader from the Releases page (the filename will be similar to Loader-1.3.0-Release.zip).
2. Extract the downloaded zip file.
3. Ensure that Java 8 or higher is installed on your computer, then run the extracted install-wrapper.exe file.
4. Wait for the script to complete. Afterward, you can launch "Age of History 3" with Finality plugin support via the Steam client.

## Lightweight Launch
If you only want to temporarily use Finality Loader, the Loader provides a quick method to launch a game instance with Finality plugin support.  
First, follow the steps above to extract the contents of the zip file.  
Then, double-click the extracted Loader core file (the filename will be similar to Loader-1.3.0-all.jar), and the Loader will automatically search for the game location and launch it.  

## Feedback
Post an issue on the Github repository's issues page, describing the problem you encountered in detail, and include the loader.log file.  
If you installed Finality Loader as described above, the loader.log file should be located in your game's root directory.
