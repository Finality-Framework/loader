# Finality Loader

[简体中文](README_CHS.md) || [繁体中文](README_CHT.md)

Finality Loader is used to load and modify code within the game, while also providing extensive functionality for plugins.

## Installation
1. Download the latest version of Finality Loader from the Releases page (the filename will be similar to `Loader-1.4.5.jar`, do **not** download `Loader-1.4.5-source.jar`!).
2. Double-click the downloaded Loader core file (the filename will be similar to `Loader-1.4.5.jar`), and choose "Install" in the GUI that pops up.

## Lightweight Launch
If you only want to temporarily use Finality Loader (or you are unable to install it normally), the Loader provides a quick method to launch a game instance with Finality plugin support.  
First, follow the steps above to extract the contents of the zip file.  
Then, double-click the extracted Loader core file (the filename will be similar to `Loader-1.4.5.jar`), and choose "Lightweight Launch" in the GUI that pops up.

## Feedback
Post an issue on the GitHub repository's issues page, describing the problem you encountered in detail, and include the `loader.log` file.  
If you installed Finality Loader as described above, the `loader.log` file should be located in your game's root directory.  
For errors that do not produce any pop-ups or a `loader.log` file, please join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/jUAxQ8bj) or [QQ group](https://qm.qq.com/q/i0YEYO1Klq) to provide feedback.
